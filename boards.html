    Forensic Technology Program Objectives
</h1>
<!--Here is the good stuff. The body paragraph contains all of the objectives for my specific degree's program. Lots of cool and fun subjects I'm looking forward to learning about.-->

<p>
1. Articulate the complexities of network and application infrastructure and apply critical thinking skills to how they affect technology forensics investigations and incident response procedures.

2. Identify and apply in a forensics context the various topologies, standards, technologies and protocols employed in computer systems, including file system formats and their attributes.

3. Evaluate, select and deploy computer forensic measures for the response, mitigation and analysis of a security incident pertaining to digital artifacts and how information was compromised.

4. Analyze and evaluate the current investigative and legal aspects of information and computer forensics, including electronic discovery, depositions, litigation and corporate personnel processes.

5. Evaluate and execute the strategies, methodologies, techniques and state-of-the-art forensics tools for the preservation of digital evidence on computer systems, network systems and other electronic devices.

6. Create tracking processes to follow the trail of electronic evidence through digital systems, including documentation, formal reporting and presentation.
